This is meant to be a companion application to smsbrowser, another project of mine. Smsbrowser is an application that allows you to see and browse through all of your SMSes on your Windows PC. This application will run on an Android phone and will periodically connect to the application on the PC and upload any new SMSes to it.

To differentiate it from similar products, the sync is directly from the phone to the PC, with no middleman server (of course, this means that your PC must have an externally accessible IP). The data is encrypted with a password that is means to be manually entered on the PC and the phone, which should prevent any third parties from intercepting the messages, corrupting the PC database, or using the connection to somehow gain unauthorized access to either the phone or PC.

Both sides of this link are currently in a very early, mostly theoretical state.

Like the other project, this is currently mostly a learning project for myself. If you find it and like it, then cool. If you want to add some features (yourself or ask me to) or use it in something else, then let me know.
